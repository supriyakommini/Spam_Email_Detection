# Spam_Email_Detection
This repository contains code for spam classification using various machine learning algorithms.
The most accurate model here is SVM.![image](https://github.com/supriyakommini/Spam_Email_Detection/assets/160637240/5566e2d4-fb30-48f7-8f92-212dc13c5172)

## Steps to run the code:

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip, the Python package manager.
-  Libraries Used
  (pandas,
  numpy,
  sklearn,
  matplotlib,
  seaborn)
  
- Copy the code provided in [SpamDetection.py](https://github.com/supriyakommini/Spam_Email_Detection/blob/main/SpamDetection.py) file into a Python file.
- Download the dataset from the repository and place it in the appropriate directory[(spam.csv)](https://github.com/supriyakommini/Spam_Email_Detection/blob/main/spam.csv)
- In the 14th line of this code, add the path of the dataset file(spam.csv).
- Run the Python script.

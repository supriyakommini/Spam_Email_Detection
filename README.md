# Spam_Email_Detection
- This repository contains code for spam classification using various machine learning algorithms.The provided code appears to be a machine learning project aimed at classifying emails as either spam or non-spam.Three classifiers are trained: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices are computed for each model.Confusion matrices are plotted using seaborn's heatmap.A bar plot comparing the number of spam and non-spam mails is created.Another bar plot showing the accuracy of different models (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree) is generated.A sample email message is taken and classified using the trained KNN model.
- The prediction result is displayed along with a message indicating whether the email is classified as spam or non-spam.Overall, the code conducts a comprehensive analysis of email classification using machine learning models.
- It provides insights into model performance and helps visualize the distribution of spam and non-spam emails.
This code can be further extended by fine-tuning the models, trying different algorithms, or performing more in-depth analysis of the dataset.

## Steps to run the code:
